<p><big>Maybe some of you have seen posters, ads, and the like carrying the exhortation ''Go Green!'' But, what does it mean to ''go green''? It takes a variety of forms, but essentially, going green means being mindful of the natural environment and making economic choices that aren't harmful to the earth. For example, this might mean purchasing a glass or ceramic water bottle instead of using disposable plastic water bottles. Plastic takes an incredibly long time to break down, and a significant percentage of plastic makes it to the oceans, where it kills plant and animal life. Going green might also involve using an all-natural hair-care product, instead of a can of aerosol spray containing toxic chemicals.

When people ''go green,'' they are practicing environmental awareness. The term means exactly what you expect it to: being aware of the natural environment and making choices that benefit--rather than hurt--the earth. In recent years, environmental awareness has gained increased attention. It is fair to say it has become a bit of a trend: from environmentally friendly tiny homes to organic food, environmental awareness is a hot topic. However, things get worse as time goes by. Today, I will show you some causes of Environmental problems, what are the effects, and how to prevent it.</big></p>

<h2>1. Global Warming</h2>
<p><big><b>What is Global Warming?</b></big></p>
<p><big>Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels burned. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere. 

The greenhouse effect is when the Sun’s rays penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is reflected off the surface cannot escape back into space. Gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels prevent the heat from leaving the atmosphere. These greenhouse gasses are carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide. The excess heat in the atmosphere has caused the average global temperature to rise overtime, otherwise known as global warming.</big></p>
<p><big><b>What are its causes?</b></big></p>
<p><big>The following are the main causes of Global Warming:</big></p>
<ul>
	<li><big>Burning fossil fuels such as Coal, Oil, and etc.</big></li>
	<li><big>Deforestation & Tree-Clearing using the Slash and Burn method</big></li>
	<li><big>Agriculture & Farming</big></li>
</ul>
<p><big><b>What are the effects if these problems occur?</b></big></p>

	<p><center><small><i>Scorching Wasteland</i> (2020) by Sebastian Morales, depicting the effects of high global temperature due to global warming.</small></center></p>
	<li><big>Acid rains can occur.</big></li>
	<li><big>Ozone layer can be destroyed, thus increasing the global temperature.</big></li>
	<li><big>Respiratory problems are most likely to occur.</big></li>
	<li><big>No roots can hold the soil, thus making the area more prone to soil erosions.</big></li>
	<li><big>Some animal habitats are being destroyed, resulting in decreasing population of that specie.</big></li>
	<li><big>Number of critically endagered specie will increase, and number of extinct species will increase too.</big></li>
	<li><big>Increasing level of Nitrous Oxide, one of the greenhouse gases.</big></li>
</ol>
<p><big><b>What are the solution to these problems?</b></big></p>
<ol>
	<li><big>Reducing the amount of electricity generated from coal and gas.</big></li>
	<li><big>Increasing the amount of electricity from clean, renewable energy sources like solar and wind.</big></li>
	<li><big>Plant trees in areas with less trees due to man-made and/or natural calamities. Stop illegal logging.</big></li>
	<li><big>Use different stock feeds can help to reduce farming's contribution to climate change.</big></li>

<h2>2. Water Pollution</h2>
<p><b><big>What is Water Pollution?</big></b></p>
<p><big>Water pollution is the introduction into land or ocean waters of chemical, physical, or biological material that degrades he quality of water. This process ranges from simple addition of dissolved or suspended solids to discharge of the most insidious toxic pollutants (such as pesticides, heavy metals, and bioaccumulative chemical compounds) that persist and prevade the environment.</big></p>
<p><b><big>What are the causes of this pollution?</big></b></p>
<ul>
	<li><b><big>Conventional</b>- Conventional or classical pollutants are generally associated with the direct input of (mainly human) waste products. Rapid urbanization and rapid population increases have produced sewage problems because treatment facilities have not kept pace with need. Untreated and partially treated sewage from municipal wastewater systems and septic tanks in unsewered areas contribute significant quantities of nutrients, suspended solids, dissolved solids, oil, metals (arsenic, mercury, chromium, lead, iron, and manganese), and biodegradable organic carbon to the water environment. <br><br>
		Although essential to the aquatic habitat, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus may also cause overfertilization and accelerate the natural aging process or also known as "<i>Eutrophication</i>" of lakes. This acceleration in turn produces an overgrowth of aquatic vegetation, massive algal blooms, and an overall shift in the biologic community from low productivity with many diverse species of a less desirable nature. Bacterial action oxidizes biodegradable organic carbon may lead to an oxygen depression.</big></li>
	<li><big><b>Nonconventional</b>- The nonconventional pollutants include dissolved and particulate forms of metals, both toxic and nontoxic, and degradable and persistent organic carbon compounds discharged into water as a by-product of industry or as an integral part of marketable products. More than <b>13,000</b> oil spills of varying magnitude occur in the United States every year. <br><br>
	Thousands of environmentally untested chemicals are rouutinely discharged into waterways; an estimated 400 to 500 new compounds are marketed each year. In addition, coal strip mining releases acid wastes that despoil the surrounding waterways. Nonconventional pollutants vary from biologically inert materials such as clay and iron residues to the most toxic and insidious materials such as halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT), kepone, mirex, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). THe latter group may produce damage ranging from acute biological effects (complete sterilization of stretches of waterways) to chronic sublethal effects that may go undetected for years. The chronic low-level pollutants are proving to be the most difficult to correct and abate because of the nature and chemical stability that can be found everywhere.</big></li>

<p><center><small><i>Poison River</i> (2020) by Sebastian Morales <br>The painting means that "You can survive for a few days without food, but without water you won't survive a single day. Polluting the entirety of water on earth is equivalent to death. Without water, life will cease to exist. So we should always give care to our most precious resource. Remember, poison the water, you poison yourself." (Morales, 2020)</small></center></p>
<ol>
	<li><big>If the water is ingested, it can damage human health.</big></li>
	<li><big>It may cause more environmental problems.</big></li>
	<li><big>It can kill living organisms.</big></li>
	<li><big>Decreasing level of water supply</big></li>
</ol>
<p><b><big>How can we prevent these?</big></b></p>
<ol>
	<li><big>Reduce plastic consumption and reuse or recycle plastic when you can.</big></li>
	<li><big>Properly dispose of chemical cleaners, oils, and non-biodegradable items to keep them from ending up down the drain.</big></li>
	<li><big>Maintain your car so it doesn’t leak oil, antifreeze, or coolant.</big></li>
	<li><big>If you have a yard, consider landscaping that reduces runoff and avoid applying pesticides and herbicides.</big></li>
	<li><big>If you have a pup, be sure to pick up its poop.</big></li>
	<li><big>Check the water supply always.</big></li>

<!-- Climate change -->
<h2>3. Climate Change</h2>
<p><b><big>What is Climate Change?</big></b></p>
<p><big>Climate Change is the defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Without drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be more difficult and costly.</big></p>
<p><b><big>What are the causes of it?</big></b></p>
<ul>
	<li><big>Water vapor. The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.</big></li>
	<li><big>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration by 47% since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.</big></li>
	<li><big>Methane. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.</big></li>
	<li><big>Nitrous oxide. A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.</big></li>
	<li><big>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.</big></li>
</ul>
<p><b><big>What are the effects if happened?</big></b></p>

<center><small><p><i>Storm Ruins</i> (2020) by Sebatian Morales<br>The painting means that although science has helped us progress so far in the modern era, able to manipulate certain factors and variables, weather is still one of the most uncontrollable factors in the environment. Due to Climate change, weather patterns are changing and deadly storms seem to be frequenting, which results in flash floods, landslides, and destruction of houses and buildings, leaving countless affected with losing their homes. If storms keep getting stronger and more dangerous, it might be the end of us.</p></small></center>
